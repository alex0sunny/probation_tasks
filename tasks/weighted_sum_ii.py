# Given a nested list of integers, return the sum of all integers in the list weighted by their depth.

# Each element is either an integer, or a list â€“ whose elements may also be integers or other lists.

# Different from the previous question where weight is increasing from root to leaf, 
# now the weight is defined from bottom up. i.e., the leaf level integers have weight 1,
# and the root level integers have the largest weight.
