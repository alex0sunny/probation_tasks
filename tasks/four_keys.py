# Imagine you have a special keyboard with the following keys:

#     Key 1: (A): Print one 'A' on screen.
#     Key 2: (Ctrl-A): Select the whole screen.
#     Key 3: (Ctrl-C): Copy selection to buffer.
#     Key 4: (Ctrl-V): Print buffer on screen appending it after what has already been printed.

# Now, you can only press the keyboard for N times (with the above four keys), find out the maximum numbers of 'A' you can print on screen.

#     1 <= N <= 50
#     Answers will be in the range of 32-bit signed integer.
