# Description

# Given an array of integers, determine the minimum number of moves 
# to make all elements equals. Each move consists of choosing all
# but 1 element and incrementing their values by 1.

# Example

# Input: 
# [3, 4, 6, 6, 3]
# Output: 
# 7
# Explanation: 
# [3, 4, 6, 6, 3] -> [4, 5, 7, 6, 4] -> [5, 6, 7, 7, 5] -> [6, 7, 8, 7, 6] 
# -> [7, 8, 8, 8, 7] -> [8, 9, 9, 8, 8] -> [9, 9, 10, 9, 9]
# -> [10, 10, 10, 10, 10]
